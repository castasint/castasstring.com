title: Securing Apps with HTTPS protocol

description: NodeJS offers a convenient and easy abstraction to create a web
  server. One of the first and foremost steps to secure the apps we're building
  is to run them with https protocol.

In this blog, we'll see how easily we can secure an app that is running on NodeJS by adding the `HTTPS` protocol.

Many of the NodeJs developers would have started their journey with NodeJs by seeing the following code.

```
const http = require("http");
const portNumber = 4500;
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "text/plain" });
  res.end("Hello, World");
});

server.listen(portNumber, () => {
  console.log(`Web Server is running at http://localhost:${portNumber}`);
});

```
The above 5(<10 with formatting) lines of code will create a web server that listens on port number 4500, and responds with the message Hello, World for every request.

The hello-world server runs on the `HTTP` protocol. This means the data exchange between the client and the server happens in plain text format.

To secure the data that is being transferred between the client and the server, `HTTPS` is the defeacto protocol as the S in `HTTPS` stands for secure and the data is transferred in an encrypted format.

So, how can we create a so-called `HTTPS` server? Like any other encryption program, `HTTPS` server also needs a secret key and an SSL certificate.

>Where do I get a certificate from? Luckily with tools like [openssl](https://www.openssl.org/) it is very easy for one to generate a certificate for development purposes. For PRODUCTION application purposes, always use a certificate that is signed by a certificate issuing authority.  

Once the certificate is in place, with the below code, we can create an `HTTPS` server and see how easily we are able to create a web server that handles the traffic securely.

```
const https = require("https");
const fs = require("fs");
const portNumber = 2443;
const options = {
  pfx: fs.readFileSync("certs/self-signed-cert.pfx"),
  passphrase: "sample",
};

const server = https
  .createServer(options, (req, res) => {
    res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "text/plain" });
    res.end("Hello, World");
  })
  
server.listen(portNumber);

```

- Remember that even though the server is running on `HTTPS` protocol, you will need to take a lot of precautions and have a defensive coding approach when working with browser-based internet-facing applications. Always look up the [OWASP-NODEJS-CHEATSHEET](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Nodejs_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html) and implement the best practices to the possible extent.
